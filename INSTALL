Q comes configured for Linux and Cygwin. Type "make" in the source directory
below, then install the q executable where you will.

Absent environment variable settings, Q expects to load its macros from
/usr/local/lib/q/. You can mv the help directory below there, or you can place a
symbolic link in /usr/local/lib to point to it here (or wherever else you want
to have it).

Alternatively, you can export Q_HELP_DIR to nominate any directory location.
(See the file help/ev).

 OTHER PLATFORMS

Under Windows, you can make Q available to CMD.EXE (i.e. outside ofthe Cygwin
environment) by copying q.exe to C:\WINDOWS. You also need to copy a Cygwin
library - you'll get told which one the first time you try to use Q.

Q should build under any POSIX-compliant system with GNU make, but the author
hasn't had access to other formerly-supported platforms for a while to test
this. The Makefile needs GNU make (may be available as gmake especially on
Solaris). Vendors' compilers should be OK absent gcc: the code tries very hard
not to use gcc extensions. Non-ANSI compiler support is being withdrawn however.
