  \/ U - U S E F I L E \/

Instructs Q to make the nominated file its standard input. The current standard
input is resumed when input from the file finishes. File input finishes on
error, the "Z" command, or end of file (which generates a warning).

Parameter
 <pathname> Name of command file. Must be specified.

Notes
 - If "Z" is missing from the end of the file, the user may experience odd
behaviour, especially during startup. Therefore Q issues a warning for missing
"Z" but otherwise continues as if it had been there.
 - If Q reports an unhandled error while obeying a Used file, the entire file
stack is unwound and standard input reverts to the original source.
 - Output suppression (by "fd y") is inherited from an invoking Use file. On
returning to an outer Use file, the suppression setting is restored to what it
was when it U-Used this file.
 - USEFILE is typically used to load Q's macros.
