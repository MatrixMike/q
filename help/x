  \/ X - C H A R A C T E R I S T I C S \/

Sets terminal characteristics, e.g. if the defaults are unsuitable. Screenedit
mode is disabled (it is, after all, unreliable until the terminal
characteristics are established) then characteristics commands are read,
terminated by another "X".

Parameters: none

Notes
 HELP on individual characteristics commands is available seperately by typing
"H X-<xistics command>". A list of these follows:
 A-end of line sequence                  B-backspace availability or value
 D-set or display per-character delay    W-Assume VT100 / X-Window eol seq
 R-carriage return sequence              T- set spaces per tab
 X-exit back to main editor
 Example
 The most common use of this command is probably on terminals that don't wrap
round to col. 80 of the previous line when they get a backspace in col. 1:
 X
 A
 X
 Tells Q there is no fast get-to-end-of-line sequence - the cursor must just be
moved forward 1 char at a time.
