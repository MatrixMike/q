  <> ^ I - I N S E R T   T A B <>

Inserts spaces until the cursor is at the next tab position. If cursor already
past the last tab  inserts 1 space.

Note
 Because individual spaces are inserted, they can also be deleted e.g. the
default tabs are 7 & 36 for FORTRAN - for a continuation line, tab out to col 7
^Y back 1 and enter a char in col 6.
