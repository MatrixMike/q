  \/ F I - I M M E D I A T E _ M A C R O \/
 Defines a new screenedit macro to be obeyed immediately.
 This command was implemented to allow U-use files to invoke screenedit macros
without having to contain real ^N characters. FI macros do not have a stack,
and any error messages they generate will refer to N101 (macro 65).
 Parameter
 <macro text> The definition. This should not be quoted.
              Otherwise it is as for the N"ewmacro" command.
