Designed primarily with PASCAL in mind, but useful also for COBOL and to an
extent FORTRAN, indent mode when enabled moves the screen cursor the same
number of spaces into a newly created line as the previous line in the file had
before accepting any input. The cursor is then said to be at the 'indent
point'. When modifying an existing line, the indent point is set at the first
non-space character in the line. More jargon:- the spaces before the indent
point are referred to as the 'indent zone'. There are three ways to move the
indent point: it can be moved further into the line by entering spaces (or
tabs, which are in fact the same thing) when at the indent point - either
inserting the spaces or overwriting existing data; the indent point can be
moved back either one position at a time by using rubout while at the indent
point or the whole indent zone can be wiped out by a ^L (left-hand kill) given
at the indent point.

Modified control char action
 ^B & ^Y will not move the cursor into the indent zone. ^H returns to the
indent point, as does ^U which does not kill the indent zone. ^L at the indent
point is special, as mentioned above, from anywhere else it only erases back
to the indent point.
