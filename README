This is Q, a line-orientated mostly WYSIWYG editor with a powerful macro
facility.

Editor source is in q; macros and help files are in help.

Both these directories have .qrc files. You will probably want to copy one of
them to your home directory so Q always has a fall-back macro set.

For most programming tasks, q/.qrc is a good starting point. It loads the
Foundation plus C macro sets. help/.qrc loads Foundation plus Word macro sets,
suitable for documents like this one.
