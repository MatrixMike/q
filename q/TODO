x command does not work in a macro
DONE: Use PAGER if no Q_HELP_CMD
DONE: Fix doco for FI
DONE: Allow FI in a macro
DONE: -i option to supply initial commands (FI syntax)
DONE: -o (offline) option to treat return to reading from stdin as q-quit
DONE:    (only available with -i)
-h option to give invocation help and display version
Be able to run in pipe
 need -i first
 need -o functionality first
  At start: open temp file; cat stdin to it, q to it
   except, use file name if supplied (and not pipe o/p(?))
  At end: s; cat temp file to stdout; rm temp file
   If o/p is not a pipe do not cat file
Can test if a macro is defined: n4007 x; ^ND^N^<4007>
Add reverse Polish calculator
Can set actual amount for "1 line forward / back" half-page / full-page
update scmacs.info a lot (for pres'n)
Re-check whether cmd.c needs to put command buffer in quotes
Some option to display version
Properly reinstate output optimisation (old hack removed as "quick fix")
 needs select() /poll()
 needs nanosleep when outputting chars
 get per-char delay from stty baud rate
 reinstate setting per-char delay (useful for testing)
INTERNALS
DONE: Header files to have conventional #ifnde / #define / #endif
  STARTED Have a bool enum for logicals
  Use atexit() so can exit on fatal errors
  STARTED: Fix runindent label squashes
  More GIVE_UP macros - use error_exit as standard label
  Use GNU tilde expansion function
  STARTED: Drop non-ANSI C support
  (Eventually) rework asg2 blocks (start with xistcs.c)
  alledit.h prototypes to have variable names
DONE: FI to have (small) stack for nested calls
DONE: U-use in a macro takes effect immediately
(maybe) replace terminal ioctls with tc{g,s}etattr
Show what arguments Q started with (?)
